This folder poem was created by Jo Suk and germinated from Digital Love Languages: Sensory Commons, a course taught by Melanie Hoff and Olivia McKayla Ross and hosted by the School for Poetic Computation. The title and concept were inspired by a Korean idiom in the opening of David Benjamin and Soo-in Yang's compilation of essays, Life Size: "이야기 꽃을 피운다", which directly translates to "this talk has bloomed flowers". 

The branches of this folder poem demonstrate how different mediums—from our bodies to our digital appendages—dictate our interaction with others. We typically initiate conversation with a desire to inform or emote, but the contents of our conversation are in reality beholden to the tools we use to communicate. If we interpret the resulting interpersonal connection as a fruit borne from the medium rather than the substance, we begin to recognize that any perceived limits or warped impressions of both participants are likewise out of our control. This allows us to wonder more empathetically about all that is left unsaid, and the richer connection that may await in a different medium.
